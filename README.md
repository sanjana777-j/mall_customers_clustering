\# Mall Customers Clustering



This is my first Machine Learning mini-project where I applied  **K-Means Clustering** to group mall customers based on their annual income and spending score.



\## Steps

1\. Load the dataset (**Mall\_Customers.csv (sorce:Kaggle)**)

2\. Visualize the data

3\. Apply **K-Means clustering**

4\. Plot customer segments with cluster centers



\## Technologies Used

\- Python

\- Pandas

\- Matplotlib

\- Seaborn

\- Scikit-learn



\## Result

The dataset is divided into 5 customer groups with clear segmentation.

1.premium customers :high income ,high spending

2.Budget customers :low income, low spending

3.Careful Spenders: High income, low spending

4.Average customers: Average income, Average spending

5.impulsive customers: low income, High spending
